    <h1> The It Pandas Of All Time </h1> 
    <img src="C:\Users\hp\Desktop\tuté\panda-bearr.png">
   </div>
    
    <p class="intro"> Get to know the celebrities of the panda world. Each icon in the list has its own heartwarming story to share and stunning visuals to show. From the charming Onigiri Panda to the remarkable Chocolate Panda, each one has a unique tale and a special place in our hearts. </p>

       <div class="HUA">

        <h2 class="oni"> The Onigiri Panda </h2>  
       </div>
         <P class="info"> Hua Hua is a 2020 baby girl who has a twin sister. Known and loved for her unique "onigiri shape" appearance, Hua Hua has developmental disabilities that make her smaller and physically weaker than other pandas her age. As a result, she doesn’t fight back when other pandas try to steal her food, so her caretaker gives her secret snacks directly. Hua Hua also struggles with climbing trees and took much longer to graduate from panda kindergarten. Despite these challenges, she is so well-loved that, at just three years old, she was appointed as the director of the Chengdu Tourism Bureau. Although she earns a lot, she doesn’t know it. </P>
       <div class="fub">

        <h2 class="kor"> The Korean Diana </h2>
       </div>
       <P class="info">Fu Bao, also a 2020 baby girl, was the first panda born in Korea. However, when she turned three, she had to return to China due to China's panda diplomatic policy. Her departure from South Korea was met with great sorrow, and many petitions were signed to keep her with her beloved caretaker, affectionately known as "grandpa." Their iconic bond was so strong that Fu Bao even mimicked his tree-climbing techniques and clung to him like glue throughout her early years.

         Now in China, Fu Bao has captured the attention of a French panda, who seems to have a crush on her. This potential suitor has sparked discussion, but many netizens are unhappy with the idea, feeling that Fu Bao is too pretty for him and that "no one is good enough for our little girl." </P>

       <img src="C:\Users\hp\Desktop\tuté\basi0.jpg">
       <h2 class="bas"> The athletic Panda </h2>  
      </div>
      <P class="info"> Basi was born in 1980 and was rescued at the age of four by a passing villager. After arriving at the zoo, she displayed athletic talent. Her caretaker discovered that she was very sensitive to music and decided to train her to become a superstar. Basi learned to play basketball, weightlift, and cycle. She traveled to San Diego for a tour, where she gained a lot of popularity. In the following years, she went on more tours, and all the donations went towards building and improving panda habitats across the country. The well-established panda bases in China today owe much to Basi's contributions. In 2017, Basi passed away at the age of 37 and went to panda heaven. </P>
      <div class="Qizai"> 
       <img src="C:\Users\hp\Desktop\tuté\qiqi.jpg">
       <h2 class="qiz"> The Chocolate Panda </h2>
      </div>
      <P class="info"> Qi Zai, the only brown panda ever known, was found in a village after being abandoned by his mother and subsequently rescued. There was some speculation about him being a virgin, but that’s not the case. Pandas are generally selective when it comes to mating, but Qi Zai is an exception; his keeper noted that he is not picky at all when it comes to female pandas. Qi Zai is a certified "lover boy" with six wives. He never retaliates or scolds female pandas, simply because he loves them too much. However, he is not as friendly towards males; he once bit his neighbor panda’s ear and even cut off a piece of it. This behavior led to his social isolation, but it didn’t stop him from mimicking his neighbor’s appearance to other pandas. </P>
